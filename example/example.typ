A Typst template produces Tufte handout in both PDF and HTML from a single source.#sidenote[PDF uses the `marginalia` package for margin notes; HTML generates Tufte CSS markup. Same API, both outputs.] Tufte's style is known for simplicity, sidenotes over footnotes, and tight integration of graphics with text.

#epigraph(
  [The web is not print. Webpages are not books. Therefore, the goal is not "websites should look like Tufte's books" but "here are techniques Tufte developed that we've found useful in print; maybe you can make them useful on the web."],
  author: [Dave Liepmann, Tufte CSS],
)

= Getting Started

Copy `src/` to your project and add to your document:

```typst
#import "src/lib.typ": tufte, sidenote

#show: tufte.with(
  title: [Your Title],
  author: "Your Name",
)

Content with #sidenote[margin notes].
```

The `tufte.with()` function accepts additional parameters:

```typst
#show: tufte.with(
  title: [Document Title],
  author: "Author Name",
  email: "you@example.com",
  date: datetime.today(),
  abstract: [Brief document summary...],
  toc: true,
  lang: "en",
  bib: bibliography("refs.bib"),             // runs after body
  config: (page: (paper: "us-letter")),
  head-extra: [                              // HTML only: injected inside <head>
    #html.elem("meta", attrs: (("name"): "description", ("content"): "..."))[]
    #html.elem("link", attrs: (("rel"): "canonical", ("href"): "..."))[]
  ],
)
```

Pick a style by name, or pass `--input style=<name>` at the command line:

```typst
#show: tufte.with(title: [...], style: "envision")
```

```bash
typst compile --input style=envision --input target=html --features html doc.typ out.html
```

We have the following styles:
- `tufte-original`
- `envision`
- `jialin`
- `terpret`
- `orange-happy`
- `bluewhite`.

Each style record can also carry a `css:` field listing one or more stylesheet URLs that the HTML target injects (`envision` loads tufte.min.css plus rstudio's envisioned overlay this way). Override the active style's CSS for a single document with the `html-css:` parameter:

```typst
#show: tufte.with(
  title: [...],
  style: "tufte-original",
  html-css: ("https://my-cdn.example/custom-tufte.css",),
)
```

Compile with:

```bash
typst compile document.typ                                          # PDF
typst compile --input target=html --features html document.typ out.html  # HTML
```

= Fundamentals

== Sections and Headings

Organize your document with titles and headings.
- Set document title via `tufte.with(title: ...)`.
- Use `=` for sections and `==` for subsections.
- Third-level headings (`===`) exist but are discouraged in the Tufte philosophy.#sidenote[Tufte: "The Feynman lectures write about all of physics in 1800 pages using only 2 levels of headings. Undergraduate Caltech physics is complicated material, but it didn't require elaborate hierarchy."]

#new-thought[In his later books], Tufte starts sections with a non-indented paragraph, and the first few words of the paragraph in small caps. Use `new-thought` for this.

== Text

Body text uses ET Book (or Palatino/Georgia fallback), with slightly muted colors for reduced contrast.#sidenote[PDF: `fill: luma(20%)`. HTML: `#111` on `#fffff8` background.] Links are shown as #link("#")[underlined text].

Standard formatting: _emphasis_, *strong*, `code`.

= Sidenotes

#new-thought[Sidenotes are the signature] Tufte element.#sidenote[This is a sidenote.] They display in the margin rather than forcing readers to the footnote or the end of the document. On small screens (HTML), they collapse to toggleable content.

Sidenotes have two parts: a superscript reference inline number, and the note content in the margin column.

If you want a sidenote without numbering, use a margin note.#marginnote[This is a margin note. No number precedes it.] On large screens, margin notes are sidenotes without reference numbers. On small screens, they toggle with ⊕ instead of a number.

Regular Typst footnotes convert to sidenotes automatically.#footnote[Like this one!]

For citations, use `sidecite()` to place the reference in the margin alongside the text.#sidecite(<tufte2001>) This provides immediate access to sources in the margin column without jumping to a bibliography.

= Figures

== Standard Figures

A native Typst `figure` is supported which appears in the main text column:

#figure(
  image("../assets/images/exports-imports.png", width: 100%),
  caption: [Exports and imports to and from Denmark & Norway from 1700 to 1780. From Tufte's _Visual Display of Quantitative Information_, page 92.],
)

== Margin Figures

We also have figures in the margin column using `#margin-figure()`

#margin-figure(
  image("../assets/images/rhino.png", width: 100%),
  caption: [Dürer's 1515 rhinoceros woodcut, from Tufte's _Visual Explanations_.],
)

This makes the text flow uninterrupted by placing the images and captions in the margin side column.
Works well for portraits, icons, or supporting details.

== Full-Width Figures

Large figures can use full page width with `#full-width[#figure(...)]`:

#full-width[#figure(
  image("../assets/images/napoleons-march.png", width: 100%),
  caption: [Minard's 1869 map of Napoleon's Russian campaign. Tufte called it "probably the best statistical graphic ever drawn."],
)]

`#full-width-figure(image(..), caption: [..])` is a quick alias for it.

= Epigraphs

Epigraphs introduce sections with thematic quotations:

#epigraph(
  [The English language becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.],
  author: [George Orwell, "Politics and the English Language"],
)

#epigraph(
  [For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.],
  author: [Richard P. Feynman],
)

= Mathematics

Inline math is supported: $E = m c^2$, $alpha + beta = gamma$, $norm(u + v) <= norm(u) + norm(v)$. Greek and common symbols use Typst names: $alpha, beta, gamma, pi, infinity, partial, nabla, plus.minus, tilde.equiv$.

Display math centers on its own line and auto-numbers#sidenote[Numbering set in `setup-html` / `setup-pdf` via `set math.equation(numbering: "(1)")`. Override locally with another `set math.equation(...)` rule.]:

$ integral_0^infinity e^(-x^2) dif x = sqrt(pi) / 2 $

Aligned multi-line derivations use `&` to mark the alignment column:

$ (a + b)^2 &= (a + b)(a + b) \
            &= a^2 + 2 a b + b^2 $

More examples.

Sums and products with bounds:

$ sum_(k=1)^n k = n(n+1)/2, quad product_(k=1)^n k = n! $

Fractions, roots, and matrices:

$ phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2, quad
  A = mat(
    cos theta, -sin theta;
    sin theta,  cos theta
  ) $

Cases and piecewise definitions:

$ abs(x) = cases(
    x   & "if " x >= 0,
    -x  & "if " x < 0,
  ) $

In HTML output every equation renders as inline SVG via `html.frame` (`typst/typst#5512`); SVG glyphs use `currentColor` to follow the surrounding text colour but carry no MathML accessibility data and are not selectable as text.

= Code

Code blocks use monospace typography:

```clojure
;; Applying a function to every item
(map tufte-css blog-posts)

;; Side-effecty loop, formatted for readability
(doseq [[[a b] [c d]] (map list
                           (sorted-map :1 1 :2 2)
                           (sorted-map :3 3 :4 4))]
  (prn (* b d)))
```

= Lists and Block Quotes

Unordered lists for non-sequential items:
- First item shows basic usage
- Second item demonstrates continuation#sidenote[Even sidenotes work within lists.]
- Third item completes the example

Ordered lists for sequential steps:
+ Compile your document to PDF
+ Compile the same source to HTML
+ Compare the outputs side-by-side

Block quotes:

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Edward Tufte])[
  Above all else show the data.
]

#quote(block: true, attribution: [Edward Tufte, _Visual Display of Quantitative Information_])[
  Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space.
]

= Full-Width Content

#full-width[
Content sometimes needs more horizontal space. Full-width blocks extend across text column and margin. Research suggests 50–75 characters per line optimizes reading comfort—but tables or specifications sometimes benefit from extra width. Use sparingly.
]

= Dual-Format Notes

The template detects output format at compile time via `sys.inputs.target`. Each function dispatches to format-specific implementations:

- *PDF*: Uses `marginalia` package for margin notes and wide blocks
- *HTML*: Generates Tufte CSS-compatible markup with proper classes

The unified API means you write once:

```typst
#sidenote[Works identically in PDF and HTML.]
#margin-figure(image("fig.png"), caption: [Caption text.])
#full-width[Extended content here.]
```

= Conclusion

Many thanks to Edward Tufte for leading the way with his work. This project builds on Tufte-LaTeX, Tufte CSS, and various Typst implementations by the community.#sidenote[See `src/lib.typ` header for full references.]
